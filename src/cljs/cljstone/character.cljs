; XXXX this is about to get more complicated.
; talking about implementing hunter's mark.
; change buffs like shattered sun to be :base-attack-modifier
; when hunter's mark is applied, remove all base attack modifiers, add a :base-attack
; XXXXXXXXX BUT THEN REAPPLY BUFFS FOR STORMWIND CHAMPION, DIRE WOLF ALPHA, ETC - FUCK
;
; ok so certain buffs can be applied by auras.
; mainly base attack, base health, and cant-be-targeted-by-spells.
; we have two main options on how to implement auras
; 1) modify all these get-base-attack, etc functions to take [minion minions-list] (i do not like this)
; 2) give affected minions an aura-modifier, and recalculate all aura modifiers whenever a minion enters or leaves the board
; so if a harvest golem is next to a dire wolf alpha, it will have a {:base-attack-aura-modifier 1}
; aura modifiers are *not* removed when minions are silenced, or have their attack or health set to 1, etc.
