; hm - how do you implement silencing something that's taken damage and has also had its HP buffed?
; or what about if something's taken damage, had its HP buffed by stormwind champ, and the champ dies?
; what about one-turn attack buffs, like from dark iron dwarf?
; i guess Modifiers will have to have associated :turn-played, :turn-expires?
; yeah, definitely go with :turn-expires.
; also: summoning sickness can be implemented as a one-turn modifier with effect :cant-attack true
; freezing will work similarly

; dire wolf alpha only needs to care about on-summon-friendly-minion, on-friendly-minion-death - no other situations cause a dire wolf alpha buff/debuff
; still need to figure out what happens when you silence something that's had its health buffed and has taken 1 damage, though.
; i guess silencing will involve recomputing base attack and health, and so you can figure it out at recompute-because-of-silence time.
; hm.
