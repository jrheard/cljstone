; TODO: to implement thaurissan, freezing trap, etc, add a :modifiers list to Cards too, just like minions
; no clue how molten giant, mountain giant, etc will work though.
; i mean there'll definitely have to be a (get-mana-cost card) function - perhaps it also takes the entire board? eg for clockwork giant
; mountain giant schema will just have a :calculate-base-mana-cost -> (fn [board owner] foo) k/v pair,
; and then *that* calculated figure can have modifiers laid on top of it. so in this way, a mountain giant can have
; original base mana cost 12, then *calculated* base mana cost 8, and can have a {:mana-cost -1} modifier in its :modifiers list
; that'll give it a final calculated mana cost value of 7. i like this system, i think it can work, neat.
