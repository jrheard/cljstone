;; Board modes.
;
; Much of the game is spent in DefaultMode - in this mode, you can play cards, attack minions,
; press "end turn", etc.
;
; Frequently, though, we'll need to enter an intermediate state, like
; "The player's playing a minion with a targetable battlecry - let's show them which characters can
; be targeted ***and wait for them to choose one***." The same thing happens when the player's played
; one of the druid class's choose-one cards, or when we're performing the initial mulligan, etc.
;
; In situations like this, we represent that intermediate state by e.g. putting a TargetingMode
; on the board's :mode key. This lets us draw the board in a way that makes it clear to the player
; what sort of input we're waiting for. Once we *receive* that input, we call the mode's :continuation
; function and pass that input along.
;
; For instance, if the player's just chosen a target for a minion's battlecry, the mode's continuation
; function will e.g. cast the battlecry on the chosen target, summon the minion in the correct position,
; and remove the minion's card from the player's hand. That's what continuation functions are for.
; This scheme lets us say "ok we're in an intermediate state, let's get user input!"; block until we've
; received that input; and then call a function that continues the flow of the game.
